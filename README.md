# Maze-Game

This is the first full program that I have ever written. I wrote this program immediately after I learned the basics of python, and then revisted it once I learned about object-oriented python. It is a text-based maze/puzzle game in which the user needs to traverse the maze properly while also securing loot in order to battle the final boss.
